Update the [CHANGELOG](../../CHANGELOG.md) with changes that affect the user of the package.

Use #tool:search/changes to identify what has changed.

Add a new `## [Unreleased]` section (or add to existing) with relevant subsections (`### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Removed`) listing changes as bullet points. Skip internal changes that don't impact users. Match existing entry formatting. Only modify the changelog.
