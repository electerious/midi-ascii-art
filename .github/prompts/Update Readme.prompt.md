Update the [README](../../README.md) to reflect changes in the codebase, ensuring documentation stays in sync with actual implementation.

Use #tool:search/changes to identify what has changed.

Review changes and update relevant sections:

- Install: Package name, installation methods
- Usage: CLI syntax, commands, options, arguments
- Options: Flags, their descriptions, defaults, environment variables
- Examples: Commands, outputs, use cases
- Development: Scripts, setup instructions

Match existing formatting and style. Update code examples to reflect current implementation. Remove outdated features and add new ones. Ensure all examples are accurate and runnable. Only modify the README.
